Report Plots Module - Business Report Visualizations

PLACEHOLDER FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION
=====================================

This module is designed to provide business-oriented visualizations for stakeholders
who need high-level insights rather than technical details. This is different from
model_plots.py which focuses on technical model performance.

SCOPE AND PURPOSE:
==================

Business Reports vs. Technical Reports:
---------------------------------------
| model_plots.py                    | report_plots.py                      |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Target: Data Scientists, ML Eng  | Target: Executives, Plant Managers  |
| Focus: Model Performance Details  | Focus: Business Impact & ROI        |
| Language: Technical (F1, AUC)    | Language: Business KPIs (Savings)   |
| Granularity: Feature-level       | Granularity: High-level Summaries   |

evaluator = ModelEvaluator()
report_generator = BusinessReportGenerator()

# Technical evaluation
technical_results = evaluator.evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)

# Business translation
business_results = report_generator.translate_to_business_metrics(technical_results)

# Executive report
report_generator.create_executive_summary_dashboard(business_results)
```

3. Develop financial impact calculation methods
4. Create operational KPI visualization functions
5. Build before/after comparison capabilities
6. Implement industry benchmarking features
7. Create automated report generation pipeline
8. Develop stakeholder-specific report templates
9. Implement interactive dashboard capabilities (if Plotly available)
10. Create export functions for PowerPoint/PDF integration

NOTES:
======
- This module should be implemented after the core technical pipeline is working
- Focus on business value communication rather than technical accuracy
- Use simple, clear visualizations that tell a story
- Always include actionable insights and recommendations
- Consider cultural and organizational context when designing reports
- Ensure all financial calculations are traceable and auditable
